# .DBN Files Container (WIP)

.DBN store a number of assets for a particular scene in RAH "Sentai-Styled" Opening movie, which is rendered in realtime.

# Header

|Offset|Size|Description|
|-------|------------|------------|
|0x00|0x4|long, Number of data pointers|
|0x04|0x4|long, Data pointer|
|* |0x4|long, DBN total size|

DBN size long value offset, is located right after last data pointer.

# Padding

Padding between header and files data start, is calculated by adding adding as many zeroes until reaching next multiple of 0x20.

Example 1: header size is 0x28 , first data will start at 0x40.
Example 2: header size is 0x1C , first data will start at 0x20.
